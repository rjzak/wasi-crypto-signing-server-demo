This is a super simple application which uses [Wasi-Crypto](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-crypto) to sign an arbitrary binary blob POSTed to `/`.

Binaries for [Enarx](https://github.com/enarx/enarx) and [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) compiled with Wasi-Crypto support for `x86_64-unknown-gnu` are available here: https://github.com/rjzak/wasi-crypto-example/releases/tag/v0.0.1.
